## Quick Start

| Building... | Start Here |
|-------------|------------|
| Automation workflow | [workflow/overview.md](./reference/workflow/overview.md) |
| Single AI agent | [agent/overview.md](./reference/agent/overview.md) |
| Multi-agent system | [workforce/overview.md](./reference/workforce/overview.md) |

## Key Concepts

### Workflows

Sequential node-based automations. Supports 300+ integrations including:

- **AI/LLM**: Claude, OpenAI, Gemini
- **Image Gen**: DALL-E, Stable Diffusion
- **Integrations**: Slack, Gmail, Notion, and more

### Agents

Configurable AI entities with:

- Custom system prompts
- Tool/MCP access
- Knowledge bases

### Workforce Patterns

- **Supervisor** — Delegation to specialists
- **Swarm** — Self-organizing agents
- **Pipeline** — Sequential handoffs
- **Debate** — Consensus through discussion
