However, there is a potential for response bias in the Likert scale question about satisfaction with new products launched by a favorite brand. Respondents may be more likely to give positive ratings due to their loyalty or affinity towards the brand, leading to an overestimation of satisfaction levels. Additionally, there may be a social desirability bias in the dichotomous question about gift preferences, as respondents may feel pressured to choose the socially acceptable option.",
