To kick things off, can you tell me a little bit about [Company Name] and the current size of your HR team? (Metrics)\n\nSarah (Prospect): Hi David, thanks for reaching out. We're a growing startup with about 150 employees, but that number is expected to double in the next year.  Right now, it's just me and an assistant handling all HR duties.\n\nDavid: Interesting.  With that kind of growth, I imagine keeping up with onboarding, payroll, and benefits administration can be challenging.  Have you encountered any specific issues in managing HR for a growing team? (Economic Buyer)\n\nSarah: Absolutely.  Everything is very manual right now, and it's getting difficult to keep track of employee records and ensure compliance.  Payroll processing takes a lot of time and leaves room for errors.\n\nDavid: That makes sense.  Can you tell me more about the impact these challenges have on your business?  For example, are there any delays in onboarding new hires, or have there been any compliance issues? (Implication)\n\nSarah: Fortunately, no compliance issues yet, but onboarding is definitely taking longer than ideal.  New hires get frustrated waiting for access to systems and benefits information.\n\nDavid:  I understand.  [Software Name] can help streamline your HR processes by automating tasks like onboarding, payroll, and benefits administration.  Our cloud-based platform allows you to manage everything in one place, saving you valuable time and resources. (Decision Criteria)\n\nSarah: That sounds promising.  Who else within the company would be involved in the decision-making process for a new HR software solution? (Decision Process)\n\nDavid: Typically, the CFO and CEO would also be involved, along with any department heads who rely on HR data for reporting purposes.\n\nDavid:  Would you be open to a demo next week where I can show you how [Software Name] can address your specific needs and help you manage your growing team more efficiently? (Champion)\n\nSarah: Sure, that sounds like a good next step.",
