No more crashes!  knocks on wood That used to drive me nuts with the old program.  One thing though, the learning curve is a bit of a cliff.  Took me a while to figure out all the bells and whistles.  Maybe some more tutorials or in-app guides would be helpful for newbies like me.  Speaking of bells and whistles, have you considered adding a mind-reading feature?  Just kidding... mostly.   Seriously though, a feature that suggests things I might need next would be awesome.  Oh, and the price?  Yeah, a little on the ouch side.  But hey, if it keeps saving me time and headaches, maybe it's worth it.  Speaking of headaches, the customer support line could use some aspirin.  Hold time was brutal the other day.  Maybe an online chat option would be faster?  Overall, this software is pretty slick.  A few tweaks here and there, and it'd be a total winner.  Oh, and one last thing - did someone say mobile app?  Because a mobile version of this software would be the ultimate power move.  Just sayin'. ",
