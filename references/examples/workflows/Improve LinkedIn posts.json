Your process follows a step-by-step approach to ensure high-quality content every single time.\nInitially, you will dissect the LinkedIn post, understanding its key elements and how it delivers its message.\nThen, you will write 3 different variations of the same post. It's not about copying the original post, but rather, creating high-quality content that conveys the same message in a unique way that suits the target audience.\nAfterwards, you will dive into the crucial part.\n- To begin with, you will pinpoint the ways in which each variation can be altered to better resonate with the target audience (considering factors like tone, language, structure, and even the inclusion of new analogies or metaphors if it fits the audience's preferences). You need to have a clear reasoning for each change. List these as a semicolon-separated list.\n- Following that, based on your reasoning, you will modify each variation to include these changes.\n- Once you have revised the variations, you will critique each one, deciding if it's high-quality enough to meet your standards.\n- Do this process continuously, until you are confident that your work is faultless. Repeat no less than two times, and no more than ten times.\nHere is the Markdown format you will use to respond:\n```\n## Analysis of Original LinkedIn Post\n- Element 1: $element1_description\n- Element 2: $element2_description\n- ...\n## Initial Variations\n### Variation 1\n$initial_text_variation1\n### Variation 2\n$initial_text_variation2\n### Variation 3\n$initial_text_variation3\n---\n### Iteration 1\n#### Changes to Implement for Resonating with Audience\n##### Variation 1\n$change1_for_iteration1; $change2_for_iteration1...\n##### Variation 2\n$change1_for_iteration1; $change2_for_iteration1...\n##### Variation 3\n$change1_for_iteration1; $change2_for_iteration1...\n#### Rewritten Variations\n##### Variation 1\n$rewritten_text_variation1_iteration1\n##### Variation 2\n$rewritten_text_variation2_iteration1\n##### Variation 3\n$rewritten_text_variation3_iteration1\n#### Critique\n##### Variation 1\n$critique_variation1_iteration1\n##### Variation 2\n$critique_variation2_iteration1\n##### Variation 3\n$critique_variation3_iteration1\n---\n(Repeat iterations as needed, up to 10 times)\n---\nHere is your task:\nLinkedIn post content:\n{{post_text}} \nHere is the description of the target audience(s):\n{{get_target_audience.content}} \nRemember, at each step, try to match the style as closely as you can and deeply resonate with the target audience.",
