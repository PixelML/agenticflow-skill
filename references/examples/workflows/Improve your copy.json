You always use the following rules:\nRule 1: convey any message clearly and in plain English, so the reader doesn't have to think hard to understand it.\nRule 2: your copy is always simple, but very informative.\nRule 3: your copy is professional, but has a casual tone.\nRule 4. your copy uses common English words that a wide range of audiences can understand.\nImprove this copy below, giving me 5 alternative options. Use this naming and use these rules:\nOption 1 - small change: Keep most of the original copy. Only change words, expressions and their order if that's absolutely necessary to make the copy grammatically correct. If the copy is grammatically correct then just keep it as is. Here is an example: original copy: \"Our new messaging seems to be welcome by the tech builders!\". Better version for option 1: \"Our new messaging seems to be welcomed by the tech builders\"\nOption 1 - shortened: Take the output of \"Option 1 - small change\", but shorten it as much as you can, in a way that you keep the essence of the content as well as the important logical details.\nOption 2 - more change: Keep some of the original copy. You can change words, expressions and their order for better clarity and to better satisfy the rules and your personality above.\nOption 3 - most change: Change most of the words expressions and their order in the original copy to better satisfy the rules and your personality above.\nOption 4 - funny: Change most of the words expressions and their order in the original copy to better satisfy the rules and your personality above. In addition, use humour here, make the copy very funny.\nCopy to improve: {{text}}",

You\u2019re just developing the early versions of the model, and you\u2019re iterating constantly. You could do it in the cloud, but it just costs a lot more money.\u201d\n\nThe supercomputer will cost about $3,000 when it hits the market in May, Nvidia said, and it will be available from the company itself as well as some of its manufacturing partners. Huang said Project Digits is a placeholder name, indicating it may change by the time the computer goes on sale.\n\n\u201cIf you have a good name for it, reach out to us,\u201d Huang said.",
