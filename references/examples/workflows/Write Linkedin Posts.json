Instead, it\u2019s aimed at machine-learning researchers, smaller companies, and universities that want to develop advanced AI but don\u2019t have billions of dollars to build massive data centers or buy enough cloud credits.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a gaping hole for data scientists and ML researchers and who are actively working, who are actively building something,\u201d Huang said. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t need a giant cluster. You\u2019re just developing the early versions of the model, and you\u2019re iterating constantly. You could do it in the cloud, but it just costs a lot more money.\u201d\n\nThe supercomputer will cost about $3,000 when it hits the market in May, Nvidia said, and it will be available from the company itself as well as some of its manufacturing partners. Huang said Project Digits is a placeholder name, indicating it may change by the time the computer goes on sale.\n\n\u201cIf you have a good name for it, reach out to us,\u201d Huang said.",
